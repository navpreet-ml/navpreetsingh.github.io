        <main>
            <b>Autonomous Driving – Car detection (Deep Learning)</b>
        </main>
        <p>
            <li>Using a dataset from drive.ai (video taken from a car-mounted camera), implemented an object detection algorithm based on YOLO Model.</li>
            <li>Input images were of size 608 x 608 x 3 and using a grid of size 19 x 19, a list of bounding of size (pc, bx, by, bh, bw, c) where c was an 80 dimensional vector representing 80 different object classes. 5 different anchor boxes were drawn by taking a max across different classes and making predictions with a threshold of 0.4.</li>
            <li>A non-maximum suppression (NMS) was used to avoid overlapping boxes and select the one with the max IoU.</li>
        </p>
        <main>
            <b>Art Generation using Neural Style transfer (Deep Learning)</b>
        </main>
        <p>
            <li>Used Neural style transfer algorithm with a given content image C and a style image S to generate an artistic image. The model used representations (hidden layer activations) based on a pre-trained ConvNet and the content cost function was computed using one hidden layer’s activation.</li>
            <li>The style cost function for one was computed using the Gram matrix of that layer’s activation and the overall style cost function was obtained using several hidden layers.</li>
        </p>
        <main>
            <b>Modified MNIST data set with two to three digits in an image (Deep Learning)</b>
        </main>
        <p>
            <li>The dataset included 40000 images with 2-3 digits in the image and the aim was to predict the digit which is larger in the size, based on the bounding box</li>
            <li>Used OpenCV to preprocess the images to find contours and crop out an image with a larger bounding contour demonstrating problem-solving and analytical skills.</li>
            <li>Used CNN (Keras TensorFlow) with several hidden layers, ReLU activation function, and RMSProp optimizer to achieve an accuracy of over 95%..</li>
        </p>
        <main>
            <b>Implementation of the paper ‘Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification’ by Yoon Kim (Deep Learning)</b>
        </main>
        <p>
            <li>Implemented the paper using different word embeddings and testing it for predicting the polarity of the Movie Reviews.</li>
            <li>Used 3 different convolutional layers with different filter sizes corresponding to different n-grams and concatenating them after the pooling layer.</li>
            <li>Were able to achieve the results of the paper and beat it by concatenating the word representation using Google News vector and GloVe word representations along with other Natural Language Processing techniques.</li>
        </p>
        <main>
            <b>Building an L-layer Neural Network from scratch using python without using dedicated libraries</b>
        </main>
        <p>
            <li>Implemented a 2 layer and an L layer neural network using python using libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, etc. The implementation did not use any of the dedicated machine learning libraries, and the function like forward propagation, backward propagation and weight updation were defined explicitly.</li>
            <li>The weights and the bias matrices were declared as zeros, randomly initialized and using ‘He’ initialization. Performed gradient checking to make sure the backpropagation was updating the weights and bias correctly.</li>
            <li>Implemented regularization, L2 Regularization and Dropout. Regularization increased the bias a little but lowered the variance.</li>
